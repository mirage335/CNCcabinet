Specialized cabinet for CNC machinery (mill, 3D printer, lathe, VLSI stepper, etc). Expected usage is as follows.

Platforms and Cleaning Supplies - >3" Top Drawer
Filament - >3" Drawer
High Tech Supplies (Lithography) - >3" Drawer
Chemical Feedstocks (Paint, Ink) - >8" Drawer
Bulk Spare Parts - >8" Bottom Drawer

Top platform height should be <3'6" from ground level, to allow CNC platform placement at eye-level from sitting position, easing alignment tasks. Interrior spaces are specifically sized to accommodate >18"x24" build platforms.

_Alternatives_
Some commercially available metal cabinets are available, offering slightly less space. Specifically consider: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-27-in-5-Drawer-Rolling-Tool-Cabinet-Black-H5TR2/203182698#specifications .
